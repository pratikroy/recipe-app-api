# recipe-app-api
In this project we will be developing REST APIs for a recipe web app. Here users will be able
to upload images for a perticular recipe using an API endpoint. In this project I will be using
Python3.7.x, Djangorestframework3.10.x and also Docker and Travis-CI. Main objective here is
to develop the whole app in a Test Driven Development.
